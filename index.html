        <h3>Public Health GIS & Environmental Surveillance (Portage County Health District)</h3>
        <p>As a contracted GIS technician at the Portage County Health District (PCHD), I supported data-driven public health decision-making through mapping, spatial analysis, and dashboard development. My work integrated field data, environmental hazards, and chronic illness reporting into intuitive visuals for public and internal use.</p>

        <h4>COVID-19 Case Tracking Dashboard</h4>
        <img src="images/covid-dashboard.png" alt="COVID-19 Dashboard" />
        <p class="caption">I maintained and expanded the COVID-19 surveillance dashboard, incorporating hospitalization trends, death counts, and zip-code-based case clusters using Tableau and ArcGIS Online. Interactive components allowed real-time queries and visual summaries for public awareness.</p>

        <h4>Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Mapping</h4>
        <img src="images/algal-bloom.png" alt="HAB Monitoring Map" />
        <p class="caption">Created early versions of a HAB monitoring map using water sample collection sites and satellite-aided detection. The goal was to inform residents and state agencies of lake conditions and bloom severity in near real-time.</p>

        <h4>Food Establishment Risk & Inspection Maps</h4>
        <img src="images/Food_data_Heat_MC.jpg" alt="Food Facility Density Map" />
        <p class="caption">Used ArcGIS Pro to create heatmaps of food safety violations, aiding in field inspection planning. These maps highlighted risk clusters and frequency zones to optimize public health interventions.</p>

        <img src="images/Food_data_Risk_MC.jpg" alt="Risk Category Clustering Map" />
        <p class="caption">Mapped risk categories (e.g., C1S, C3L) across Portage County using symbology and clustering, simplifying regulatory classification into an easily digestible format.</p>

        <img src="images/Food_data_MC.jpg" alt="Food Facility Types Map" />
        <p class="caption">Icon-based visualization of retail food establishments, sorting them by type (e.g., FSO, RFE) to support licensing and zoning compliance operations.</p>

        <h4>Geocoding & Spatial Data Enhancement</h4>
        <p class="caption">I geocoded thousands of address-based inspection records, converting tabular datasets into point-based spatial layers using R and ArcGIS Pro. This enabled the creation of all maps above â€” transforming raw address lists into actionable health intelligence.</p>

        <div class="tools">Tools: ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, R, Tableau, Geocoding APIs</div>
