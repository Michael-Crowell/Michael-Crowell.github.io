      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a climate scientist and geospatial data analyst with experience across environmental, health, and academic sectors. I specialize in making complex data understandable and actionable — whether through mapping, visualization, or automated analysis workflows. My projects have ranged from modeling tornado-favorable environments to building public health dashboards, using tools like R, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and Tableau. I have experience transforming multi-million-cell datasets and multidimensional arrays in R into highly refined, targeted visualizations. Above all, I focus on turning data into tools that people can actually use.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Public Health GIS & Environmental Surveillance – Portage County Health District</h3>
        <p>During my contract with PCHD, I applied GIS, data visualization, and statistical analysis to track infectious diseases, identify environmental health hazards, and optimize inspection workflows. I created dashboards, mapped public health infrastructure, geocoded thousands of addresses, and helped visualize regional chronic disease data using advanced spatial tools.</p>

        <h4>COVID-19 & Chronic Disease Dashboarding</h4>
        <a href="images/covid-dashboard.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/covid-dashboard.png" alt="COVID-19 Dashboard"></a>
        <p class="caption">Built and maintained a COVID-19 dashboard in ArcGIS Online and Tableau to track case trends, hospitalization rates, and chronic disease comorbidities. The dashboard was used for public communication and internal health surveillance.</p>

        <h4>Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Surveillance</h4>
        <a href="images/algal-bloom.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/algal-bloom.png" alt="HAB Monitoring Map"></a>
        <p class="caption">Developed a HAB heatmap using water sample point data and historical bloom records. This ArcGIS Pro-based output supports ongoing public health hazard communication and environmental tracking workflows.</p>

        <h4>Food Infrastructure Mapping</h4>
        <div class="image-grid">
          <a href="images/Food_data_MC.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Food_data_MC.jpg" alt="Food Locations Map"></a>
          <a href="images/Food_data_Risk_MC.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Food_data_Risk_MC.jpg" alt="Food Risk Map"></a>
          <a href="images/Food_data_Heat_MC.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Food_data_Heat_MC.jpg" alt="Food Heatmap"></a>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">Mapped restaurant inspections, food facility risk levels, and inspection density patterns using ArcGIS Pro. These outputs were used by sanitarians to improve inspection routing and food safety planning.</p>

        <h4>Geocoding & Address Standardization</h4>
        <p class="caption">Created automated workflows in ArcGIS Pro and R to geocode thousands of addresses and join them with FIPS-coded geographic units. This enabled regional analysis of food safety, COVID outbreaks, and chronic illness data by location. These workflows supported all other spatial visualizations in this section.</p>
